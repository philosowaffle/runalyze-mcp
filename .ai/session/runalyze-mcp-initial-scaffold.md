## Progress Made

### Completed Tasks
1. **Solution Scaffolding**: Created .NET 9 solution with ASP.NET Core project and NUnit test project
2. **Package Management**: Added ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore, NSwag.Core, and test packages
3. **Basic Configuration**: Configured Program.cs for port 8080, health endpoint, and DI registration
4. **Custom HTTP Client**: Implemented comprehensive RunalyzeApiClient with all documented endpoints:
   - Activity endpoints (upload, status, collection, individual)
   - Download endpoints (FIT, GPX, KML, TCX, etc.)
   - Statistics endpoints
   - Equipment endpoints (collection, individual, categories)
   - Health endpoints (bulk upload)
   - Metrics endpoints (all 10 metric types with CRUD operations)
   - Race result endpoints
   - Tag endpoints
5. **Test Coverage**: Implemented 61 comprehensive unit tests covering:
   - Configuration (environment variables, base URL)
   - Header management (token, content-type)
   - All endpoint methods (with and without parameters)
   - All test categories organized by endpoint type
6. **Code Cleanup**: Removed OpenApiToolRegistration code and tests as requested
7. **Documentation**: Updated knowledge base with comprehensive API reference and testing strategy
8. **MCP Server Integration**: All 47 Runalyze API endpoints are now exposed as MCP tools and tested
9. **Docker Containerization**: Multi-stage Docker build with optimization
10. **Docker Compose**: Production and development configurations with health checks
11. **End User Documentation**: Comprehensive README.md with setup, usage, and examples

### Technical Achievements
- **61/61 tests passing** with comprehensive coverage
- **All Runalyze API endpoints** implemented as C# methods and MCP tools
- **Proper DI registration** using HttpClientFactory
- **Environment variable support** for base URL override
- **Content-type negotiation** (application/ld+json preferred, fallback to application/json)
- **Base64 file upload support** for activity and health data
- **Token-based authentication** via HTTP headers
- **Pagination support** for collection endpoints
- **Comprehensive error handling** via HttpResponseMessage
- **Docker multi-stage build** with optimized container size
- **Docker Compose configuration** with health checks and Traefik integration
- **Complete documentation** with setup guides and usage examples

### Architecture Decisions
- **Custom HTTP client** instead of dynamic OpenAPI loading (per user request)
- **Singleton registration** with HttpClientFactory for proper lifecycle management
- **Async/await pattern** throughout for non-blocking operations
- **Organized by endpoint category** for maintainability
- **Consistent parameter patterns** across similar endpoints
- **Docker Compose profiles** for development and production environments
- **Health check integration** for container monitoring

## Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

### 1. GitHub Actions CI/CD (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Task**: Set up CI/CD pipeline
- **Goal**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Deliverable**: Working GitHub Actions workflows
- **Timeline**: 1 session

### 2. VSCode Development Experience (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Task**: Create VSCode tasks and launch profiles
- **Goal**: Enhanced development workflow
- **Deliverable**: VSCode configuration files
- **Timeline**: 1 session

### 3. Final Polish and Release (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Task**: Code review, release notes, and initial release
- **Goal**: Production-ready release
- **Deliverable**: Tagged release with documentation
- **Timeline**: 1 session

## Notes
- All tests are passing (61/61)
- Knowledge base has been updated with comprehensive documentation
- Session information is current and accurate
- MCP server integration is complete and all endpoints are exposed as tools
- Docker containerization is complete with Docker Compose support
- End user documentation is comprehensive and production-ready
- The custom HTTP client approach provides better control and testability than dynamic OpenAPI loading

## Outstanding Issues
- None currently - all implemented functionality is working as expected
- Next phase focuses on CI/CD pipeline and development experience enhancements
