# Development Workflow

You always follow a specific workflow when planning or making changes.

## Workflow

There are 8 very important steps in this workflow. Its is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you ALWAYS follow ALL 8 STEPS.

1. Check for existing [Session](mdc:.cursor/rules/002-cursor-session.mdc) information
2. Research your [knowledge base](mdc:.cursor/rules/knowledge-base-reference.mdc) for relevant information.
2. Plan your changes
    1. Document a clear and concise step by step plan to accomplish your goal in your [Session](mdc:.cursor/rules/002-cursor-session.mdc)
3. Follow Test Driven Development to Implement your changes
    1. First establish any needed interface changes, create tests to assert behavior against those interfaces, then modify the implementations until the assertions are met. 
4. Verify the code compiles and all tests pass
5. Update user documentation to cover any new information users should know as a result of these changes
6. Update your personal [knowledge base](mdc:.cursor/rules/101-knowledge-base-maintenance.mdc) to document any significant changes or design choices that will be useful in the future
7. Update your [Session](mdc:.cursor/rules/002-cursor-session.mdc) to document progress made, next steps, or outstanding issues
8. Create a [git commit](mdc:.cursor/rules/003-cursor-git-commit.mdc)

REMINDER, make sure you have followed ALL 8 STEPS.
