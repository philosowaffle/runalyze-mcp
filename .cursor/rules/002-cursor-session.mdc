# Cursor Session

You may maintain Todo Lists, Documentation, and State in the [.ai/session](mdc:.ai/session) folder.

## Usage

### Saving Session Information

After planning, write your detailed plan and Checklist to a markdown file in [.ai/session](mdc:.ai/session/) folder. This will help you keep track of progress and pick up where you left off if we need to take a break.

#### File Format

Session files should be created with the following naming convention: {short-task-description}.md

The files should follow this format:

```markdown

# Session Goal

{brief description of the goal, purpose, or task of this session}

## Requirements

{detailed requirement information}

## Plan

{detailed plan of action}

## Todo

{markdown list of check boxes documenting steps to accomplish the Plan}

## Notes from last session

{markdown bulleted list of useful information from last session}


```

### Reading Session Information

Before resuming work on a task, check if there is relevant information in [.ai/session](mdc:.ai/session) documenting where you left off last time, what has already been done, and what is remaining.
